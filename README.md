About this app:

I was building this app base on the concept of a Task Management Tool.

The UI consists of 2 screens: 

**Overview:** 
- Displays a list of all the groups along with their completion status. 
- When clicking on a group, it will render the detail screen.

**Detail:**
- Displays a list of all the tasks in the selected group.
- Allows the user to toggle the completion status of unlocked tasks.
